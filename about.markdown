I'm Kaely.<img alt="Kaely's Portrait" class="portrait_image" src="/images/site/kaelylinkerheadshot.png" />

It&rsquo;s pronounced like &ldquo;Kay-Lee&rdquo;. My parents named me after a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ4oaLUilBc"> tragic 80&rsquo;s rock ballad by the band Marillion</a> and changed
the spelling so my southern family wouldn&rsquo;t separate my name into two names (like Ellie May). For my friends and family from
the Baltimore area I&rsquo;ll also respond to &ldquo;Kale-lee&rdquo; or, of course, the classic &ldquo;Hon&rdquo;.

My brother says I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;Creative Generalist&rdquo; which is a more polished version of my usual &ldquo;jane-of-all trades&rdquo; moniker.

I design and maintain WordPress websites; handle all types of graphic design for print and web; manage and create content for multiple social media presences; write creatively for blogs or other content; and create, film, and edit video. You can see more in my <a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a>.

I started with web design as an angsty teenager, teaching myself HTML coding in order to publish my cringey poems to a wider audience. In college, I bought my own coffee shop (yep, you read that right) and, needing an affordable way to market myself, took extra classes in design on the side. I don&rsquo;t own that shop anymore, but I did walk away with a crippling coffee addiction and a new love of creative communications. I love connecting with people, dreaming of possibilities, and working together to create something magical. I love telling a good story, casting the vision, and moving people upwards.

<h2 id="personally"><a name="personally"></a>Personally:</h2>
I really, really love coffee. I really, really love &ldquo;The Office&rdquo;. I really, really love Jesus.</p>

I live outside of beautiful Annapolis, Maryland with my charming husband Chris and my three kids: Isaac, Benjamin, and Juliana. You&rsquo;ll find us playing board games or video games together
and with our large and loud families.

I love the outdoors and animals, and spend as much time underwater or in a hammock as I can. I love to read but I find myself in the middle of three books at any given time and the stacks
by my bed and on my desk are unruly (to put it mildly).
